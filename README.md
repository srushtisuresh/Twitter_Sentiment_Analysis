# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

Pandemic had augmented angst among Indian SubContinent about the chinese products. The tweets were raging in on the
platform and coming to a conclusion with different opinions was only becoming difficult. During this time, "make in india" movement was super popular
as well. Thus, I wanted to analyze the sentiments of the people related to boycotting chinese market products and research on how it effected the 
Indian Market in return. The idea behind the project was not only to develop a model to analyze the twitter sentiments but also to learn to implement 
different ML Algorithms and differentiate between their performance metrices.
